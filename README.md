# COGS 118c Final Project

**Group Members:** Gloria Kao, Yifan Lou, Sasha Rashid, Yunjin (Grace) Zhu

**Dataset:** Human EEG https://github.com/hengxu19/COGS118C

## Abstract

The dataset we are using contains 88 scalp EEG recordings from a combination of three types of patients: those with Alzheimer’s disease, those with frontotemporal dementia, and healthy patients. The EEG was taken using 19 scalp electrodes with a sampling rate of 500 Hz and a resolution of 10 uV/mm. By using the data from three different frontal channels (fp1, fp2, f3), we compare power spectrum and time-frequency characteristics between AD patients and healthy age-matched subjects. We hope to see differences in EEG bands that can signify the different cognitive abilities in healthy vs. AD subjects. 

**Research question:** Do the different EEG signals between healthy and AD patients reflect differently in the power spectrum, and what does it tell us about an Alzehimer patient’s cognitive ability?
